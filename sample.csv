A distribution where mean < median < mode is:,Symmetrical,Positively skewed,Negatively skewed,Uniform,B
"In a screening test, high sensitivity ensures:",Fewer false negatives,Fewer false positives,Both decreased,None,A
Specificity indicates:,True positives,True negatives,False negatives,False positives,B
A study comparing malaria prevalence in two villages is:,Case-control,Cross-sectional,Cohort,RCT,B
Confidence interval narrows when:,Sample size decreases,Sample size increases,SD increases,p-value high,B
A scatter plot is used to:,Show mean difference,Show correlation,Show frequency,Show variance,B
A vaccine trial conducted on randomly selected children is an example of:,Case-control,Cohort,Experimental,Cross-sectional,C
"In a population with high disease prevalence, the predictive value of a positive test will:",Increase,Decrease,Remain same,Depend on sensitivity,A
"If two variables rise together, their covariance will be:",Negative,Zero,Positive,Random,C
A researcher selects every 10th person in a list. This is:,Random sampling,Systematic sampling,Stratified,Cluster,B
Double blinding helps to:,Remove selection bias,Remove observer bias,Reduce confounding,Reduce loss to follow-up,B
"If a test is highly specific, it minimizes:",False positives,False negatives,True positives,Sensitivity,A
Null hypothesis states that:,There is no difference between groups,Difference exists,Association proven,p-value is <0.05,A
Power of a statistical test increases when:,Sample size increases,Significance decreases,Variance increases,Bias increases,A
Odds ratio = 1 implies:,No association,Positive association,Negative association,Confounding present,A
Which measure is not affected by extreme values?,Mean,Median,Mode,Range,B
